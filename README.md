# adz

**adz** is a mini-wrapper CLI tool to run my Emacs development environment and others like graphic, web, and IDE tools, and to `rsync` into my NixOS machine.

## Dependencies

- [Marie](https://github.com/krei-systems/marie)

## Build

If there's no `marie` yet:

```sh
make clone
```

Then build it using:

```makefile
make build
```

To remove the executable:

```sh
make clean
```

## Usage

After building, an executable named `adz` will be created. You can run it from within the project directory using:

```sh
./adz --help
```

To make it accessible globally, add this to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshenv`, etc.):

```sh
export PATH="$HOME<your/project/directory/>:$PATH"
```

To test if it's working properly:

```sh
adz h
```

## Lisp Flakes

For NixOS users with flakes in their machine for development environments, modify the special variable named [`*path*`](https://github.com/eldriv/adz/blob/main/src/core.lisp) to fit your own pathname.

Then run:

```lisp
adz lf e    # To run Emacs development environment
adz lf sv   # To check SBCL version
```

> **NOTE:** You can extend and change any values depending on your own needsâ€”just see the source code to do that. If you have NixOS installed and want to use flakes, then this CLI codebase structure will be beneficial for you.
