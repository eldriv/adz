* ems 

It is a mirror of  [[https://github.com/eldriv/scripts/tree/main/emacs-shell-script][emacs-shell-script]] , instead of using bash script, I used clingon—CLI APP—to run my Emacs development environment into my machine.

* Usage

To ensure everything works correctly, it's important to have the right directory structure,
#+begin_src lisp
├── ems.asd              ;; ASDF
├── src                  ;; Directory
│   └── ems.lisp         ;; Lisp file containing the CLI developmenet
├── Makefile             ;; Makefile
#+end_src
Once the project is set up, we can build it using this command,
#+begin_src makefile
$ make build
#+end_src
After building, an executable named ems will be created. You can run it from within the project directory using,
#+begin_src
$ ./ems --help or ./ems
#+end_src
To make it accessible globally, insert this into your shell configuration files—.bashrc or .zshenv,
#+begin_src lisp
export PATH="$HOME<your/project/directory/>:$PATH"
#+end_Src
Then run,
#+begin_Src lisp
$ ems r  ;; To run Emacs development environment
$ ems sv ;; To Check SBCL version
#+end_Src
